It sounds like you're making good progress! In addition to the user authentication and room management models, here are some additional models you might need to implement the features you've outlined:

    Room Status Model: This model will store information about each room, such as its current cleanliness status, inventory levels, last inspection date, and any flagged issues. It will also track the room's availability for bookings.

    Room Image Analysis Model: This model will analyze the images uploaded by staff to assess room cleanliness and compare them with ideal room images generated by the Generative AI model. It will need to perform image analysis tasks like wrinkle detection, floor cleanliness assessment, and detecting any damage or abnormalities.

    Inventory Management Model: This model will keep track of the inventory levels of amenities provided in each room, such as towels, toiletries, and minibar items. It will need to monitor stock levels, generate alerts for low stock, and update inventory levels after each inspection.

    Inspection Report Model: This model will generate detailed reports for each inspection performed by staff. It will record the inspection date, staff member responsible, cleanliness assessment results, inventory check results, any flagged issues, and recommendations for improvement.

    Scheduled Checks Model: This model will manage the scheduling of monthly, weekly, and daily room checks. It will assign inspections to staff members, generate reminders for upcoming checks, and flag rooms for subsequent inspections if they fail to meet cleanliness standards.

    Damage Detection Model: This model will detect abnormalities such as broken furniture, stains, or damage in the room images uploaded by staff. It may also estimate the cost for replacement or repair of damaged items.

By implementing these additional models, you'll be able to build a comprehensive hotel management system that addresses the needs of both staff and admin users. Each model will play a crucial role in automating various tasks and ensuring efficient management of hotel rooms and amenities.
