                Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep
                skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo,
                and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned, 6 to 8
                minutes. Transfer shrimp to a large plate and set aside, leaving
                chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add piment√≥n, bay leaves,
                garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring
                often until thickened and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add
                saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a
                boil. Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with
                artichokes and peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of
                the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to
                medium-low, add reserved shrimp and mussels, tucking them down
                into the rice, and cook again without stirring, until mussels
                have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7 minutes more.
                (Discard any mussels that don't open.)
